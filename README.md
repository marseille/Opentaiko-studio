# OpenTaiko-studio

A repo diverging from https://github.com/marseille/OpenTaiko -- intended solely as an unofficial "studio" or workstation, for activities surrounding chart creation. 

Incorporated here are feature-adds that maximize chart editing efficiency and minimize delays inherent in the traditional composition loop.

Currently the editor supports the following:
* F5 hot reload for
  * chart notes in .tja
  * Lyric changes in .lrc file
* Offset + Movieoffset reload on restart, instead of from song select.

I should stress here that this is -**_not_**- intended for actual playing. The changes made here may have implications in other parts of the game I'm unaware of, no one should expect to have a 100% quality-assured consistent product for hours of play. On that note, be aware that if you (for some reason) decide to use this, all code is provided AS-IS. With no expectation of support and/or maintenance. This is a strictly unofficial build of OpenTaiko, and no support requests will be met with response.
